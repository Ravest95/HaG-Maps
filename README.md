# MapRipperProject - Heroes and Generals - 2016
MapRipperProject is a Unity game engine project, that contains recreated maps from the game Heroes and Generals, released in 2016.

Notice: Maps are recreated and don't have 100% accuracy, although it is really close and possibly the best you can achieve right now.
