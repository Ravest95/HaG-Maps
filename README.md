# Heroes and Generals - 2016 - Maps
Maps extracted from the game Heroes and Generals - 2016 with Ninja Ripper and converted to Blender format.

# Limitations:
Due to how Ninja Ripper works (extracts the models that are present on the screen at that time from the GPU memory) a lot of models were lost, simple because they were not visible at the extraction time. In addition to that almost all models were extracted in the lowest LOD possiable, sometimes literaly in box shapes.

# Thanks:
Elkkut - Providing Ninja Ripper files.

BluRay - Sorting objects in Blender.
